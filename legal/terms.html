<p>GeyserTimes is a collaborative project. A volunteer group operates the infrastructure and websites, but content, including observation data, comments, and forums, are contributed by users. While it is a goal of the GeyserTimes project to facilitate an accurate open database of geyser activity throughout the world, GeyserTimes does not and cannot proactively review all contributions and other edits. Therefore, we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any submitted community content. Suspected data problems may be reported to the <a href="mailto:boardsecretary@geysertimes.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Board of Directors</a>.</p>

<p><strong>You are responsible for your own actions.</strong> You are legally responsible for your contributions and edits, so for your own protection you should exercise caution and avoid contributing any content that may result in criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws. Although we may not agree with such actions, we warn contributors and editors that authorities may seek to apply other countries’ laws to you, including local laws where you live, or where you view or edit content. GeyserTimes generally cannot offer any protection, guarantee, immunity, or indemnification.</p>
