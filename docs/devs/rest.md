# REST API V5 Documentation

The GeyserTimes.org API gives your application access to the most comprehensive geyser eruption database on the internet. The API generally follows RESTful principles. Responses are returned in JSON format. 

:::caution

Expect documentation to be a work in progress. If you have specific requests regarding this API contact [support@geysertimes.org](mailto:support@geysertimes.org).

## API Usage Policy

GeyserTimesâ€™s servers are run on donated resources. They have strictly limited capacity. Heavy use of the GeyserTimes API may adversely affect other's ability to interact with the database and is an abuse of the individual donations and sponsorship which provide hardware and bandwidth.

GeyserTimes data are free for everyone to use. Our data servers are not.

Clients may be blocked without notice if they are affecting the service level for others or causing data corruption. We will try to contact relevant parties if possible, but cannot guarantee this.

Requirements:

* Heavy use is forbidden without prior permission from the System Administrators. Polling the same URL more than once per minute is considered abusive--please be gentle.
* Clearly display license attribution.
* Do not actively or passively encourage copyright infringement.

| ```lastReportTime``` | the most recent eruption time for the geyser known at time of prediction |
| ```intervalNumber``` | if the last eruption time is known: 1. If the most recent eruption time is assumed, the prediction is based on a double interval: 2. Some predictors may choose to predict based on a triple interval or more with wider prediction windows. |

### POST Requests

Not yet available. Your application will need to be registered and will receive an API key.

### Notes

Variables in the URL displayed between [] are optional

GeyserIDs can be either GT.org's numeric ID or string names of the geyser

URLs marked with * are CORS enabled for your slick JavaScript/AJAX apps.

### Additional Parameters

By default, all datetime values are Unix epoch time. Adding a truthy `GET` paramater `iso` (`?iso=1` or `?iso=true`) to the end of the URL will return datetimes in ISO 8601 format.

Add a truth `GET` parameter `primary` to limit eruptions to only those identified as "primary."
