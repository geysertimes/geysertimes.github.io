## Data required to submit an eruption

To enter an observed eruption, you need the following information:

* the name of the geyser, 
* the date and time of the eruption, 
* the time accuracy of your observation, i.e., 
    * exact, if you observed the eruption from the start, 
    * near start, if you observed the eruption within a minute of the start, 
    * in eruption, if you observed the eruption, but not from the start, 
    * electronic, if the eruption was determined from monitoring data (e.g. temperature logger or seismometer), 
    * approximate, if you observed the eruption, but did not note the exact time and therefore approximate it, or if you know an eruption has occurred, but do not know its start time (e.g. for overnight eruptions), 
* (optionally) the duration of the eruption, 
* as required additional labels, i.e., 
    * the webcam label, if you observed the eruption on a webcam, 
    * the initial label, if you observed the initial eruption of a series at a geyser known to erupt in series (e.g. Lion),
    * the questionable label, if you think an eruption occurred, but aren't sure, 
    * the major or minor label (or the long or short label for Old Faithful), if you observed such an eruption at a geyser that has multiple eruption types (e.g. Castle),
* (optionally) additional information for Grand, i.e., 
    * the delay code, i.e., 
        * D# with the number representing the number of Turban eruptions after the delay, if the interval between Turban eruptions was 25m or greater,
        * V# with the number representing the number of Turban eruptions after the delay, if Vent overflowed, but Grand didn't start even though it was time for Turban or Turban started, 
    * the start type, i.e. Grand or Turban, depending on whether Grand or Turban initiated the eruption, 
    * the number of bursts, 
    * the star label, if the second burst lasted 1m15s or greater, 
    * the pound label, if the third burst lasted 1m15s or greater, 
    * the end type, i.e. Continue or Quit, depending on whether Vent and Turban continued or quit after the eruption of Grand,
    * the number of afterbursts,
* the observer(s) of the eruption, assumed to be you, the entrant, if left empty, and,   
* (optionally) a comment.
