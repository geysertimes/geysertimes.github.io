# Glossary and Abbreviations

## Geyser Terminology

The following words are commonly used to describe eruptive activity. Geyser terminology is not always applied consistently to different geysers, but the following definitions will provide you with a starting point.

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **geyser** | A feature that periodically erupts a mixture of water and vapor. |
| **perpetual spouter** | A feature that continuously erupts a mixture of water and vapor. |
| **bubble shower** | Vigorous boiling at the surface of a pool (e.g. activity at Beach Spring and Crested Pool). |
| **preplay** | Splashes that occur prior to an eruption. |
| **eruption start** | Somewhat geyser-specific, but a good rule of thumb is that the start marks the "point of no return." |
| **water phase** | The part of an eruption dominated by water. |
| **steam phase** | The part of an eruption dominated by vapor. Not all geysers enter a steam phase, but for those that do, the transition to steam phase is considered the end of the eruption. |
| **duration** | The time between the start of the eruption and the end of water phase. |
| **interval** | The time between two eruption starts. |
| **quiet interval** | The time between an eruption start and the _end_ of the previous eruption. |
| **series** | At some geysers, this refers to a group of eruptions with similar intervals separated by a relatively long interval. The first eruption in a series is called the **initial**, especially if that eruption is different in some way to the eruptions that follow (e.g. Lion and Dome). |
| **burst** | As a noun, this word refers to a segment of a single eruption that is separated by brief pauses (e.g. Grand). Notable exception: bursts are called **series** at Great Fountain. |
| **post-eruptive** | The state of a geyser after it has finished an eruption. Experienced observers can assess post-eruptive behavior to determine the rough timing of a missed eruption. |
| **major** and **minor** | Some geysers have significantly different types of eruptions. **Major eruptions** are set apart by their greater intensity, taller height, and/or longer duration. Conversely, **minor eruptions** are set apart by their lower intensity, shorter height, and/or shorter duration. Note that the designation of major eruptions at a certain geyser does not necessarily imply that the other eruptions are designated minor, and vice versa. |
| **long** and **short** | The terms for major and minor eruptions of Old Faithful that are still in use for historical reasons. **Short eruptions** last for â‰¤2.5 minutes and **long eruptions** last for >2.5 minutes. This distinction is important because Old Faithful has a bimodal interval distribution, and the eruption type controls whether the next interval will be shorter (average 68 minutes) or longer (average 94 minutes). |

## Time Code

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **ie** | _In eruption._ Eruption was observed, but not from start. |
| **ns** | _Near start._ Eruption was observed within a minute of the start. |
| **E** | _Electronic._ Eruption was determined using monitoring data (e.g. runoff temperature). |
| **A** | _Approximate._ Time was approximated, either because
* an eruption was seen but the time was not noted, or
* an eruption was inferred from post-eruptive activity.  |
| **wc** | _Webcam._ Eruption was observed via webcam. |
| **ini** | _Initial._ Eruption was the first eruption in a series. Only used for geysers that erupt in series. |
| **(?)** | _Questionable._ Observer thinks that an eruption occurred, but isn't sure. |
| **maj** | _Major._ Eruption was a major eruption. Only used for geysers that have different eruption types. Will appear as _long_ for Old Faithful. |
| **min** | _Minor._ Eruption was a minor eruption. Only used for geysers that have different eruption types. Will appear as _short_ for Old Faithful. |

## Duration Code

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **~** | _Approximately._ Eruption is known to have lasted about the given time. |
| **>** | _Greater than._ Eruption is known to have lasted at least the given time. |
| **<** | _Less than._ Eruption is known to have lasted no more than the given time. |

## Grand Code

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **D#** | _Turban Delay._ The interval between Turban eruptions was 25m or greater. The number after the letter "D" is the number of Turban eruptions until Grand started after the delay. |
| **V#** | _Vent Delay._ Vent overflowed but Grand didn't start even though it was time for Turban or Turban started. The number after the letter "V" is the number of Turban eruptions until Grand started after the delay. |
| **G** | _Grand._ Eruption was initiated by Grand. |
| **T** | _Turban._ Eruption was initiated by Turban which started shortly before Grand. |
| **\*** | _Star._ Duration of the second burst was 1m15s or greater. | 
| **#** | _Pound._ Duration of the third burst was 1m15s or greater. |
| **C** | _Continue._ Vent & Turban continued after the eruption. |
| **Q** | _Quit._ Vent & Turban quit after the eruption. | 

### Here are some full code examples.
**T2\*C:** Turban started before Grand, two bursts, second burst was >1m15s, Vent and Turban continued
**V2/G1Q:** Grand erupted two Turban cycles after a Vent delay, Grand started before Turban, one burst, Vent and Turban quit
**D5/D2/T1C:** Turban delay, then another Turban delay five cycles later, then Grand erupted after an additional two Turban cycles, Turban started first, one burst, Vent and Turban continued

## Great Fountain Code

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **p=#** | _Pause._ The quiet pause between the "one-meter boil", the start of the eruption, and the first burst of water. The number after the equal sign is the interval of the pause in minutes. |

## Observer Code

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **OFVCL-EV** | Old Faithful Visitor Center Log - Electronic Version | 
| **RTED** | Ralph Taylor Electronic Data |
