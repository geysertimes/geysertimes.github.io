# Glossary and Abbreviations

## Geyser Terminology

The following words are commonly used to describe eruptive activity. Geyser terminology is not always applied consistently to different geysers, but the following definitions will provide you with a starting point.

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **geyser** | A feature that periodically erupts a mixture of water and vapor. |
| **perpetual spouter** | A feature that continuously erupts a mixture of water and vapor. |
| **bubble shower** | Vigorous boiling at the surface of a pool (e.g. activity at Beach Spring and Crested Pool). |
| **preplay** | Splashes that occur prior to an eruption. |
| **eruption start** | The beginning of the water phase, usually the first burst of water. _Note:_ Its defintion is geyser-specific (e.g. "one-meter boil" for Great Fountain). |
| **water phase** | The part of an eruption dominated by water. |
| **steam phase** | The part of an eruption dominated by vapor. |
| **eruption end** | The end of the water phase and for eruptions with a steam phase, the transition to steam phase. |
| **duration** | The time between the start of the eruption and the end of water phase. |
| **interval** | The time between two eruption starts. |
| **quiet interval** | The time between an eruption end and the start of the following eruption. |
| **series** | A group of eruptions with similar intervals separated by a relatively long interval (e.g. Lion and Dome). The first eruption in a series is usually called the _initial_. |
| **burst** | A segment of a single eruption that is separated by a brief pause (e.g. Grand). _Note:_ Bursts are called _series_ at Great Fountain. |
| **post-eruptive** | The state of a geyser after it has finished an eruption. Experienced observers may be able to assess post-eruptive behavior to determine an _approximated_ start time of a missed eruption. |
| **major** and **minor** | Eruption types. _Major_ eruptions are usually defined by their greater intensity, taller height, and/or longer duration (e.g. Castle and Lone Star). _Note:_ The designation of major eruptions at a certain geyser does not necessarily imply that the other eruptions are designated minor, and vice versa. |
| **long** and **short** | _Major_ and _minor_ eruptions of Old Faithful. _Short_ eruptions last for â‰¤2.5 minutes and _long_ eruptions last for >2.5 minutes. This distinction is important because Old Faithful has a bimodal interval distribution, and the eruption type controls whether the next interval will be shorter (average 68m) or longer (average 94m). |

## Time Code

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **ie** | _In eruption._ Eruption was observed, but not from start. |
| **ns** | _Near start._ Eruption was observed within a minute of the start. |
| **E** | _Electronic._ Eruption was determined using monitoring data (e.g. runoff temperature). |
| **A** | _Approximate._ Eruption was observed, but exact time not noted and therefore later approximated, or eruption not observed and inferred from post-eruptive activity. |
| **wc** | _Webcam._ Eruption was observed via webcam. |
| **ini** | _Initial._ Eruption was the first eruption in a series of a geyser known to erupt in series. |
| **(?)** | _Questionable._ Observer thinks that an eruption occurred, but isn't sure. |
| **maj** | _Major._ Eruption was a major eruption of a geyser with different eruption types. |
| **min** | _Minor._ Eruption was a minor eruption of a geyser with different eruption types. |

## Duration Code

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **~** | _Approximately._ Eruption is known to have lasted about the given time. |
| **>** | _Greater than._ Eruption is known to have lasted at least the given time. |
| **<** | _Less than._ Eruption is known to have lasted no more than the given time. |

## Grand Code

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **D#** | _Turban Delay._ The interval between Turban eruptions was 25m or greater. The number after the letter "D" is the number of Turban eruptions until Grand started after the delay. |
| **V#** | _Vent Delay._ Vent overflowed but Grand didn't start even though it was time for Turban or Turban started. The number after the letter "V" is the number of Turban eruptions until Grand started after the delay. |
| **G** | _Grand._ Eruption was initiated by Grand. |
| **T** | _Turban._ Eruption was initiated by Turban which started shortly before Grand. |
| **\*** | _Star._ Duration of the second burst was 1m15s or greater. | 
| **#** | _Pound._ Duration of the third burst was 1m15s or greater. |
| **C** | _Continue._ Vent & Turban continued after the eruption. |
| **Q** | _Quit._ Vent & Turban quit after the eruption. | 

:::note

The following examples may help to clarify the meaning of the codes:

**T2\*C:** Turban started before Grand, two bursts, second burst was >1m15s, Vent and Turban continued
**V2/G1Q:** Grand erupted two Turban cycles after a Vent delay, Grand started before Turban, one burst, Vent and Turban quit
**D5/D2/T1C:** Turban delay, then another Turban delay five cycles later, then Grand erupted after an additional two Turban cycles, Turban started first, one burst, Vent and Turban continued

## Great Fountain Code

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **p=#** | _Pause._ The quiet pause between the "one-meter boil", the start of the eruption, and the first burst of water. The number after the equal sign is the interval of the pause in minutes. |
