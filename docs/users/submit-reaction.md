## Flag an entry

:::caution

Flags are _only_ intended to mark eruptions and notes that are either incorrect or inappropriate. In all other cases, comments are considered the proper way of communication between users of GeyserTimes. 

Entries that have been flagged twice are considered as a risk for the data integrity of the GeyserTimes database and are automatically deleted. However, correct usage of the provided flagging tool by the user community is crucial for this assumption.
