# Fix problems with contributing data

If you have problems contributing data, follow the instructions below. For problems not listed here, please contact our [support](mailto:support@geysertimes.org) for further assistance. 

## Locked entries

If you want to edit or contribute data to a locked eruption or note, please contact our [support](mailto:support@geysertimes.org) with the details.

## Incorrect primary entry in grouping of eruptions

When multiple observers submit entries for the same eruption, a primary entry is selected by an algorithm (detailed below) that groups the entries and attempts to determine which is most accurate and informative. However, the system is not perfect. If you recognize an eruption where the primary entry was incorrectly selected, or a situation where an entry was not grouped with other entries for the same eruption, please report the entry to our [support](mailto:support@geysertimes.org) so the issue can be resolved manually. 

:::warning

Flagging is reserved for marking incorrect or inappropriate entries. Do not flag an entry because of an error with primary entry selection.

### Selection of primary entries 

Primary entries are selected based on time accuracy and data quality. First, eruptions marked as questionable (?) are disadvantaged. Primary eruptions are then selected based on time accuracy, meaning exact eruptions are favored over electronically recorded (E) eruptions, which are favored over eruptions observed near start (ns), which are favored over eruptions observed in eruption (ie), which are favored over eruptions with an approximate (A) time, respectively. 

If multiple eruptions with the same time accuracy are entered, the one with the earlier start time after rounding to the minute is chosen as the primary eruption. This strategy of rounding start times ensures eruptions entered up to the second are not disadvantaged.

In the case observations with the same start time and time accuracy are entered (which frequently occurs), eruptions with the initial (ini) label set are first preferred, and then eruptions with the major (maj) or minor (min) label set, as these entries add additional information. Subsequently, eruptions entered with a duration are favored, since durations are also considered valuable information, especially for research on specific geyser behavior.

If multiple entries are still considered equal by this approach, observations made in the field are favored over those made via the webcam, as field observations are typically more accurate. Next, eruptions where the start time is entered up to the second are considered as more precise and then eruptions with a comment are considered as more informative. 

All else equal, the time an entry was entered decides on the primary eruption, with the first one entered becoming the primary eruption. 

| Selection Order for Primary Entries |
| :---: |
| not questionable (?) |
| time accuracy: Exact > E > ns > ie > A |
| start time _(rounded to minutes)_ |
| with ini label |
| with maj/min label |
| with duration |
| not webcam |
| with start time in seconds |
| with comment |
| time entered |

## Missing geyser or other hydrothermal feature

If a geyser or other hydrothermal feature is missing in our database, you can request its addition to GeyserTimes using our [online form](https://forms.gle/xeiS9tcFsDuiooHg8). 

To submit a feature request, you need the following information:

* your email address and your GeyserTimes username, 
* the name of the geyser, at best already being in use by an authoritative source, like _The Geysers of Yellowstone_ by T. Scott Bryan, GOSA publications, the Yellowstone National Park or USGS websites, or other reputable and established sources,
* the geyser basin and group/complex in which the geyser is located, following conventions established by T. Scott Bryanâ€™s _The Geysers of Yellowstone_, 
* the exact location of the geyser, ideally as decimal coordinates (latitude and longitude) or otherwise as a short written summary along with uploaded photos, 
* (optionally), typical eruption intervals and durations, and, 
* a reason why the feature should be added to the database. 

:::tip

To identify the location, the best source of adequate satellite imagery probably is Google Maps, where you can tap to retrieve coordinates. If you are unable to do so, please upload photos of the feature so its coordinates can be retrieved for you. Remember, while close-ups are good for identifying a feature, wider shots are better suited for localizing it.
