## Retrieve database content for statistical analysis

Probably the easiest way to retrieve eruptions is using the **Retrieve** page. This page will allow you to retrieve up to 5,000 eruptions of one or more geysers:

* Visit [GeyserTimes](https://geysertimes.org) with your browser.
* In the top toolbar, click **[Retrieve](https://geysertimes.org/retrieve.php)**.
* Click the **Geysers** text field and select the geysers of which you want to retrieve a dataset of eruptions.
* Click the text fields **Date Start** and **Date End** and select the time range of eruptions to be retrieved.
* Click **Search**.

The following advanced options are also provided: 
* the option to retrieve only electronic or non-electronic eruptions,
* the option to retrieve primary entries only, 
* the option to retrieve in-basin or webcam observations only,
* the option to include or exclude the eruption id, entrant, observer, duration, or comments to the dataset, 
* the option to retrieve times in the geyser's local time zone, in UTC, or both, and, 
* the option to display the dataset in the browser or to download the dataset as a CSV file.

For research purposes it is recommended to use the nightly updated **Archive**. All eruptions of a single geyser or alternatively of the database can be downloaded there:

* Visit [GeyserTimes](https://geysertimes.org) with your browser.
* In the top toolbar, click **[Retrieve](https://geysertimes.org/retrieve.php)**.
* In the **Looking for data to do research?** card, click **[GeyserTimes Archive](https://geysertimes.org/archive)**.
* Click on the dataset you want to download.
